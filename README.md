## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Please refer to CONTRIBUTING.md to know how to contribute to the repository.
